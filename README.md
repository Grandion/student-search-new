# Student Search IITK

Now in Next.js!

This is a remake of the original Student Search (located [here](https://github.com/pclubiitk/student-search)) in Next.js. Student data is stored in a MongoDB Atlas cluster for (mostly) free. Various improvements have been made to the original, including:

- Full PWA Support (making it cross-platform)

- Family Tree Integration (data provided by Counselling Service IITK)

- Dark Mode

- Better Searching
